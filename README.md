# Crypto-Exchange-App

* The project was bootstrapped with *Create React App* and *Redux toolkit* template.

* The project contains only *functional-based* components.

* Redux logic - *Redux toolkit* was used to cover Redux logic and immutability of the Redux store (*Immer* and *Redux thunk* are built-in features in *Redux toolkit*).

* Initially we fetch data from all providers and remap their results so we could have consistent data structure in our app state.

* App UX is handled missing endpoint results.

* It was added sorting functionality.

* Use 'yarn start' command from the root project directory to start the project in development mode.

* You need to use the browser extension to avoid the CORS policy problem from localhost origin (applyied for Bitfinex).

* I do not have enough time to read and apply all documentations for all provided APIs (Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, Kraken).

* For historical rates is used one endpoint for all providers.

* I do not have enough time to use WebSocket connection for updating rates periodically.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
